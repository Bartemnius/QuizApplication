It is the engine that enables Java applications to run on any device or operating system, providing the 'write once, run anywhere' capability that Java is known for. \n\nEssentially, the JVM is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.When a Java program is compiled, it is transformed into bytecode, a platform-independent code that can be executed on any device equipped with a JVM. This feature is what makes Java programs highly portable. The JVM interprets this bytecode and translates it into machine-specific instructions that can be executed by the underlying hardware. The JVM performs several other critical functions, such as memory management, garbage collection, and providing a secure execution environment. Memory management ensures that objects are allocated and de-allocated efficiently, while garbage collection automatically removes objects that are no longer needed, freeing up memory and preventing memory leaks. Moreover, the JVM plays a crucial role in the performance of Java applications. It includes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime, improving the performance of Java applications by making them run faster. \n\nIn summary, the JVM is a cornerstone of the Java programming language, enabling it to function as a cross-platform, high-performance, and secure programming environment. Understanding the JVM's workings and capabilities is essential for any Java developer to fully leverage the strengths of Java in application development."},

Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism): Multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters. 2.

Servlets are managed by a servlet container which handles the networking and lifecycle aspects, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic."},

The HAVING clause filters groups based on conditions applied to aggregated values (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG) calculated for each group.
